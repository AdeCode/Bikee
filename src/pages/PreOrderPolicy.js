                    There is a 30-day return policy on our electric bikes with certain model exclusions (See Revv1 14 Day Return Policy below). Within 30 days, if you are not satisfied with the bike, please contact our support team and keep your bike assembled. If the return conditions below are met, we will provide you the correct address for return.
                    <p className=''>
                    As long as the bike arrives back to us in the condition it was delivered to you in, you will receive 100% refund. We only charge a restocking fee for orders that are cancelled or shipments returned that were never opened, assembled, and tested. From your refund we will deduct the cost of cleaning and repairing any aspects of the bike that were damaged of left dirty by the buyer returning the bike. Buyer is responsible for the cost of return shipping. Buyer is also responsible for safely packaging and returning the bike to us. If you have damaged or failed to safely package the bike, we will deduct the damages from the refund. We suggest keeping the original packing material and box until you are 
                    sure the bike is the right fit for you. This way you will be able to safely repackage and re-secure the bike for return shipping.
